			<br/>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Live music has been an obsession of mine ever since I saw Green Day in the Fargodome at the age of 16. Around the same time I was taking photography classes in high school and became obsessed with the concept of capturing the energy and emotion of concerts through images. Ever since I have been doing my best to capture the electric moments that any music goer craves.<br/>
			<br/>
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have been practicing photography since 2009 and have been using photoshop since I was a kid. Feel free to contact me with any of your visual needs! If I can't find a way to make your creative vision a reality, I will do whatever I can to help you find someone who can.
